# Tutorial: TradingAgents

`TradingAgents` is a framework that uses a team of specialized **AI agents** to perform a deep financial analysis on a stock. It orchestrates these agents in a step-by-step *workflow*, where each agent, like a *Market Analyst* or *News Analyst*, contributes its findings. The agents use a set of **tools** to fetch real-world data and communicate by updating a shared **state**. A user can monitor this entire process in real-time through an interactive **CLI dashboard**. The system is designed to improve over time by *reflecting* on its past decisions and storing lessons in a long-term **memory**.
